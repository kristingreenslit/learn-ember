Why did you choose this subject?
- I'm always interested in learning something new, and Ember's been on on my to-do list for a while. It worked out well that others in the class were interested in it as well and we could learn together.

How were you first made aware of it?
- It was mentioned in GA as part of the MEAN stack, and I also heard about it from a Sr. Developer at a meetup.

What problem does it solve?
- Provides another tool for client-side js projects

How does it solve the problem (conceptually)?
- Front-End engineers building complex single-page apps using an MVC framework

Why does one use it?

What are the alternatives?
- Angular, Backbone

What is it similar to, if anything?

Who is maintaining it?
- The Ember Core Team: http://emberjs.com/team/

What is your opinion on the technology after having built something with it?
- I haven't finished the tutorial, but it seems like another js framework to use that could be a powerful tool to use depending on your project scope

- It is a fairly new technology and some of the tutorials reference some legacy components (such as depending on the emblem templating language)
